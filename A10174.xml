            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>As there is but one lyne to leuell righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly to the marke, a hundereth wayes to ſhut a ſtray: ſo there is but one true faith and Religion, whereby true Chr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtians goe to Heauen but an hundreth falſe faiths and Religions which lead Ignorant ſoules and vn Godly men to Eternall damnation.</p>
            <p>when the Catholiques reprotch the Proteſtants of their deſagreeing in the Chiefeſt heads of Religion, manie of them now a dayes anſwere, that a man maybe ſaued in any Religin that is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, pouyding he beleue to be ſaued in the Blood of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>This is the cauſe wherefore they ſay althought the Maeſſe, praying to the Saincts, honoring of Images in Temples be Idolatrie neuertheleſſe that good Papiſts may be ſaued in any Religion,
<pb facs="tcp:6453:4"/>
becauſe they beleeue in Chriſt this is ane of the greateſt deceits that Sathan could inuent for the damnation of man when he perſuadetd him that he may be ſaued in anie Religon that is profeſſed in the world prouyding he beleeue to be ſaued in the Blood of Chriſt for when a man is surely perſuadetd to be ſaued this way, he careth not of what Relagion he be, whether he be a Proteſtant or Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane, Trinitar or Anabaptiſt, Caehol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que or heretique beeauſe that all Relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions are a like to him prouyding he beleeue in Chriſt, and ſo by this perſuaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of Sathan he abideth with alſe great ſecuritie in a falſe Religion, which lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Ignornt ſoules to Euident perdition as yf he were in a true Religion, which is but one. and likewiſe the only ſure way to ſaluation.</p>
            <p>Moreouer according to the falſe opinion of Proteſtants all heretiques which euer were ſince the birth of Chriſt (how blaſphemous that euere their her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſies were againſt God) ſhould be ſaued, as Arrius which deny the diuinitie of Chriſt, Pelagius which affirmed that man might be ſaued by hes owen proper vertue without the grace of God and all
<pb facs="tcp:6453:4"/>
other ſuchlike blaſphemous heretiques, becauſe they did belue in Chriſt and preſeſſe them ſelues to be Chriſtians &amp; ſo euery one ſhould goe as ſecurely to Heauen with a falſe faith and blaſſphem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Religion, which opinion is ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trapie to the holy Scaripture and vprig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ht Reaſon that it is a wonder how ſuch an opinian ſhould enter in the braine of man.</p>
            <p>For S. Paule ſayeth, that there is but one faith as there is but one God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>The ſecond point which is to be remarked in their doctrine is that they teach men to be made free from the keeping of all Lawes as much of God as of man by their faith in Chriſt &amp; libertie of their Goſpell. ſo according to this doctrine men may adore Idolls, blaſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heme the Name of God contemne and

Chapter, wherein wee prooue that the Proteſtants and Puritans by their Peſtilent doctrine lead Ignorant ſoules to a theiſme and plaine Infidelitie.</p>
            <p>The third point which is to by mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of their doctrine is that they teach that the beſt workes,<note place="margin">Luther in aſſert. drt <hi>31.32.36.</hi> Cal. lib. <hi>3</hi> Inſt. cap. <hi>12.</hi> ſect, <hi>4.</hi> et cap. <hi>14</hi> ſect. <hi>6.</hi>
               </note> which Iſſue from Godly Chrſtians are but deadly ſinnes, when they are weighted in the Iudgme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nt of God, ſo according to this rule of their doctrine it is all a like to adore God or to worſhipe an Idoll, to praiſe God or to blaſpheme his holy Name, to hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour his parents or contemne them to kill a man or ſaue his life, to ſleepe with his Nighbonrs wife or with his owen, to with holld his Nighbours goods or to render them, to declare in Iudgment the truth or to foreſware him ſelfe, to

            </p>
            <p>They teach by the ſame rule that it is but folie to a man to paine him ſelfe to doe anie good workes, becauſe that when he hath done all that lyeth in his power it is but a deadly ſinne, which can not helpe him to Heauen. wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now good Reader yf you will Iucge ſinccrly according to the truth, all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialitie, will you not ſay that this Rel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igion of the Proteſtants is more like to Epicurus Religlon, where all libertie is giuen to ſatiſfie the concupiſſonce of the fleyh than the Religion of Chaiſt, which reſtrineth the concupiſſance in all diſordained deſires by preacaing of penitence in aſſes and Secke Cloth, by diligent watching in faſting &amp; praying to keepe vs from tentation of the fleſh the Deuill and the wordl.

               <p>That is to ſay: it hapned me once about midnight to be ſuddenly awakned out of my ſleepe, there Sathan begoud this diſputation with me, heare me (ſaid he) moſt learned Doctour Luther, thou knoeweſt thou haſt al moſt daylie Celebrated Maſſes theſe 15 yeeree by paſſ? what yf ſuch priuie Maſſes were horible Idolatrie? what yf the Bodie &amp;

               <p>Now I will aſke of them yf they hade faith in Chriſt when they did eate the roſted Gooſe with the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion bread and wine, which did reſt after the action as they hade befor? then I ſay that they eate Chriſt by the ſame faith as really with the roſted Gooſe and Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion briad and wine together as they did before with the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion bread and wine alone, for ſomuch as faith Reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it ſelfe vp to Heauen to receiue Chriſt there ſitting at the reght hand of God the father, and not to the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion bread and wine to receiue him there with a corporall mouth within the compaſſe of their Sacrament, according to their doctrine.</p>
               <p>Yf they will reply and ſay that they hade faith
<pb facs="tcp:6453:34"/>
habitually and ot actually in Chriſt, becauſe the dead Eliments (that is the roſted Gooſe with the bread and wine) could not ſtirre vp their faith actually to beleeue in Chriſt, without the word Ioyned to them to quicken them as the ſoule doth the Body.</p>
               <p>Then I will thus argae aginſt them yf the Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſter in the meane time they did eate the roſted Gooſe with the bread and wine Ioyned the word to the dead Eliments (that is to the roſted Gooſe with the bread and wine) to quicken them as the Soule doth the Body, ſaying Bretheren in the Lord, you muſt recall to memorie that Chriſt did ſhedde his blood vpon the Croſſe for remiſſion of your ſinnes &amp; ſitteth preſnnly at the right hand of God and from thence ſhall come to Iudge the quicke and the dead, who likewſe hath created &amp; ordained this roſted Gooſe with the bread and wine to nuriſh your Bodies corporally, as the Body of Chriſt nuriſheth your Soules Spiritually eaten by faith. The muſt confeſſe that they receiue the Bodie of Chriſt as truly by actull faith in Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the roſted Gooſe with the bread and wine as they did before with the bread and wine alone.</p>
               <p>For ſo much as their faith is als free to goe vp to Heauen to Chriſt their Spiritually in eating the roſted Gooſe with the bread and wine, as it was in receiuing the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mumion bread and wine alone before, and no more ſtay made to faith to Exerciſe her office in their action then in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb facs="tcp:6453:34"/>
vnleſſe they Graunt ſome vertue to be in the Comunion bread and wine, which maketd them to recerue Chriſt more Effectually then is in ſaith it ſelfe, which thing they will neuer graunt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that all the Purians affirme that there is no other recciuing of Chriſt but only by faith in a Spirituall forme without receeuing of him in the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion bread and wine with corporall mauth.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee Euidently how there is no differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence Indeede betweene theire Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion and a prophaine banquete prepared in a Tauerne or Inne for the corporall Suſtentaion of men, or a Iewiſh Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion, which is without all vertue &amp; grace to cure a ſicke Soule, for they agree all in that point of Religion that Sacraments giue no Spirituall vertue or grace to the receiuer, but that all vertue and grace of Iuſtification and remiſſion of ſiinnes are only obtained by faith in Ieſus Chr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt, and not by the Sacrament or good workes.</p>
               <p>Now to conclude this purpoſe wee affirme that their faith is as Effectuall and true in Chriſt when they eate the roſted Gooſe, as it wee when they reciued the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion, ſo wee ſay that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue Chriſt by the ſelfe ſame faith as truly when they eate the roſted Gooſe Ioyned with the bread (as is recited aboue) concliſion that faith receueth Chriſt as well with the roſted Gooſe as with the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion braed. becauſe Chriſts Bodie is no more within the compaſſe of the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ion bread

                  </gap>able to God, but by M. R. Abercromies and M. Ihon Hamiltouens Sorceries and Enchantments which did hound this hellish dogge vpon M. Rober Bruce, to vexe &amp; torment him according to their deſire. But this fond Inuention of theirs is no thing else but a malitious detrction and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged lye. Firſt becauſe M. Robert Abercromie at that tim was out of this Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>untrey in a Colledge of the Ieſuits built in the Towne of Brownsberge in the Kingdome of pole. Secondly Catholique Prieſts are accuſtomed by the power of God giuen to them to caſt Deuills out of poſſeſſed perſons, but not to ſend the Deuill to vixe any man as the falſly alleadge. Thridly yf the Miniſters haue the true Religion and the true aſſiſtance of God (as they falſly challenge to them ſelues) why doe they not chaſte away the Deuill by the vertue of God for approbation of their new Goſpell as Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que Prieſts doe for confirmation of the Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que Religion. But ſeing they haue noe power ouer Sathan, as Catholiqe Prieſts haue, they muſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ufeſſe that they are but heretiques &amp; the bound ſlaues of Sathan, and no true Chaiſtians.</p>
               <p>This blacke dogge at the laſt (as the euent did shew) did tranſform him ſelfe in a familiare ſpirit, which M. Robeart Bruce did call his God, for M. Robert and his familiare ſpirit were ſeene confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring familiarely in his Church about twell howres
<pb facs="tcp:6453:42"/>
at euen or midnight with great lightes in his Church, which theis familiare ſpirit of M. Robe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rts did furnish, for M. Robeat being but him ſelfe alon talking with this ſpirit did take no candles to his Chich for to cauſe ſuch light in his Church as was ſeene M. Robert after long conference with this familiare ſpirit ſaid to his friends and nigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours that it was God that came to teach him ſuch heads of Religion as he should preach publickly to the people.</p>
               <p>But the Godly Reader may coniecture what a familiare ſpirit this was that came to teach <hi>M.</hi> Robert about midnight by the hiſtories of Luther Zuinglius the firſt Pillars of this New Religion which they reherſe of them ſelues, as <hi>M.</hi> Robert doth preſently of him ſelfe.</p>
               <p>For Luther thus writteth of him ſelfe in his Booke of priuie Maſſes. <hi>Contigit mihi ſemel ſub mediam noctem ſubito experge fiernet ibi Satan mecum cepit eiuſmodi diſputationem audi (Inquit) Luthere Doctor perdocte, noſti enim te quindecim annos celebraſſe Miſsas priuatas pene quotidie. Quid ſi tales Miſſae priuatae eſſent horrenda Idolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latria. Quid ſi ibi non affuiſſet corpus et ſanguis Chriſti, ſed tantum panem et Vinum adoraſſes, et aliis adorandum propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuiſſes, Cui ego Reſpondi, ſum Vnctus Sacerdos, accepi Vnctionem, et Conſecrationem ab Epiſcopo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That is to ſay. it hapned me once bout midnigt to be ſuddenly awakned out of my ſleep. There Sathan begaud this diſputation with me heare me (ſayeth he moſt Learned Doctor, Luther, Thou
<pb facs="tcp:6453:42"/>
knoweſt that thou haſt almoſt dayly celebrated priuie Maſſes thiſe 15 yeares agoe what yf ſuch priuie Maſſes were hoarible Idolatrie what yf the Bodie and blood of Chriſt were not realie there, But only that thou dideſt adore bread and wine, &amp; offere the ſame to be adored by others. whome to I anſwered, that I was a Prieſt, and that I had receuued vnction, and conſecration from A Bishope.</p>
               <p>After theſe words Luther rehearſeth all the arqumets which Sathan did bring fourth to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oue that the Maſſe was Idolatrie, which argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of Sathans the Proteſtants (as yet) peruſe to day againſt Catholique Romains to prooue after the Imitation of Sathan that the Maſſe is no thing els but plaine Idolatrie. And as Sathan did firſt call the Maſſe Idolatrie, ſo the Proteſtants and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans as his diſciples call the Maſſe Idolatrie as M. Roberte Bruce doth alſo but wee Catholique Romains eſteeme the Maſſe to be the much more holy, and diuine ſeruice of God, that Sathan doth abhorre the ſame, as he doth all other holy things Profitable to mans ſaluation as the cheefe author of all Idolatrie, and hereſie to purchaſe the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naoion of mans preſently as he did In ages all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee will let the Proteſtants followe after Sat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han In this behalfe as they doe in manie other things, conſidering that no friendlie admonition can moue them to acknowelege their fault, and
<pb facs="tcp:6453:43"/>
Correcte the ſame for their owen ſaluation.</p>
               <p>Zuinglus the patriach of the Puritans writeth the hiſtorie of him ſelfe, in his booke intituled the helpe or ſoccour of the Euchariſt. ſaying that a ſpirit came in the night and did teach him that Chriſt bodie was not with in the Euchoiſt or holy Sacrement really, but only tyepically or figurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uely, as the thing ſignified as in the figne. he writteth alſo that he did not knowe whether this ſpirit which did teach him his leſſon, was blacke or white.</p>
               <p>Conſidering now that M. Robert Bruce doth followe the doctrine of Luther and Zuinglius in calling the Maſſe Idolattrie as Sathan and Luther did before him, and in denying Chriſt Bodie and Blood to be realy within the compaſſe of the holy Sacrment as Zuingliue familiare ſpirit did teach him, what should wee ſurmiſe of M.

               <p>when M. Robert vanteth of him ſelfe that he ſawe the Triuitie and Preache the ſame publlckly to the people, wee should beliue S. Ihon the Euangeliſt rether then a fauce glorioons lying heretique. for S. Ihon thus wreteth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>Thus you ſee how the Proteſtants deny they Redemprion of man from ſinne &amp; Iniquitie with the deſtruction of deadly ſinnes in the ſoules of Chriſtians, which are Sathans workes which deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction of ſinne should haue beene the chiefe fruit of Chriſts paſſion, conſequently they muſt deny Chriſt to be Redempton of the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all men are detairied in captiutie of Sathan by deadly ſinne, vnſeparable fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſoules of men (as the Proteſtant write of the concupiance by other deadly ſinnes in the which Sathans King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome &amp; dominion ouer men doe properly conſiſt</p>

               <p>For ſo long as deadly ſinne remaineth within the ſoules of men, &amp; them ſelues workers of Iniquirie they muſt be ſonnes of Sathan and not of God as Chriſt him ſelfe ſayeth.

but not in Godly Catholiques.</p>
               <p>Thus yf deadly ſinne maketh the man ſonne to the Deuill, as the holy Scripture auoucheth, is Impoſſible that he be alſo ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne to God, &amp; likewiſe brother to Ieſus Chriſt, who is the firſt borne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt many bretheren.

               <p>wee anſwere that their aſſertion in this behalfe is both falſe and blaſphemous, becauſe they make Chriſt (man) Iniurious vnto God, and kindly friend to Sathan, when they make him to manta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine and protect with an Externall veale &amp; Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his Iuſtice, the ho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nour and ſeruice done to Sathan, by homicids, Theeeues, adulterers, deceitfull Traitors and other malitious ſinners.</p>

Sathan, then to maintaine and deſend him and all his ſeruants in their crymes and miſdeeds, with an Externall veale of his Iuſtice Imputed to them, &amp; to ſaue Sathans ſeruants, that they come not to the Iudgment of God to be accuſed and to be puriſhed for their ſinnes &amp; miſdeeds is not that grateful ſeruice made to Sathan and fortification of his Kinghome againſt the aduancment of the Kingdome of God, which conſiſteth in the Expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Sathan, &amp; all deadly ſin<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>es out of the ſoules of men (when Chriſt did caſt ſeauen Deuills out of Marie magdalen, when he did purge her ſoule from deadly ſinne, as S. luke reporteh in his Eua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ngell. 8.2.) to the end that as Sathan did Raigne and domine in their ſoules as their Prince &amp; King by deadly ſinnes ſo God should thereafter Raigne in their ſoules as Lord &amp; Prince by Inherent grace whereby men doe ſeure &amp; obey him, &amp; ſo men are tranſlated from the power of Sathan to the King, dome of his deare ſonne.</p>
               <p>Therefore Chriſt cnme not in this worldd to hide Sathan &amp; his workes in the ſoules of men by an Externall veale &amp; Imputation of his Iuſtice but Rather to Eypell Sathan out of the ſoules of men, as he ſayeth him felfe Ihon. 12.31. now the prince of the world is caſt out, and likwiſe to deſtroy his workes which are deadly ſinnes, as of the Deuill, for this purpoſe the ſonne of God was made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that he might dſolue &amp; driue away the work is of the Deuill.</p>
               <p>VVherefore yf our Lord Ieſus did come in this

               <p>The fifte Reaſon is that the ſonne of God did ſuffer death to the end that the Iuſtification of the lawe might be fullfilled in vs and not in Chriſt only as the Proteſtants affirme.</p>
               <p>S. Paul thus writteth, Rom 8 3. for (that was Impoſſible to the lawe in as much as it is weake becauſe of to flesh) God ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding his owen ſonne in the ſimilitude of ſinnefull flesh, and by ſinne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned ſinne that the Iuſtification of the lawe might be fullfilled in vs, which walke not after the flesh but after the ſpirit.</p>
               <p>You may ſee by theſe words of the apoſtls that God did ſend his ſonne to condemne ſinne by the Sacrifice of his flesh offred vpon the Croſſe to the end that the Iuſtification of the lawe might be fullfilled in vs.</p>
               <p>VVherefore yf ſuch Iuſtice as the lawe of God doth require of vs be not ſound in a true Chriſtian by the grace of Chriſt, then God is diſapeinted of his Intent, which ſend his ſonne to offer him ſelfe in a Sacrifice to purge vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our ſin<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>es &amp; Iniquities,

               <p>Now to conclude this purpoſe behoiding that deadly ſinne abiceth ſtill in the Proteſtants ſoules and that all their workes alſo are deadly ſinnes worthie of dammnation, yf they be Iudged acco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rding to their worthineſſe in the Iudgment of God as it taught by them ſelues, it followeth conſeque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ntly

               <p>Fourthly it is taught by them that they are als certen of their Iuſtifiication and ſaluation, as they are certen that Chriſt is the ſonne of God, and that ſuch as vvill not beleeue his ovven Iuſtification and ſaluation as he beleoueth Chriſt to be the ſonne of God, not to be Eſteemed as a faithfull Chriſtian but an Infidell, and likevviſe that faith is the only true Iuſtifiing faith, vvhereby they beleeue them ſelues, as certenly to be Iuſtified (that is to be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eiued in the fauour and grace of God vvith remiſſion of their ſinne of God.</p>
